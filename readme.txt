This plugin simply allows you to add Twitter's official share button in your posts with the shortcode `[tweetthis]`

== Description ==

Twitter has just released its own original Share button. And this plugin simply allows you to add Twitter's official share button in your posts with the shortcode `[tweetthis]`.

(I also released a plugin which automatically adds the button to the end of the post - [you can check it out here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/original-tweet-button/ "Original Tweet Button").)

The plugin works fine but it has no options or something else that you can tweak. However, it will be constantly developed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's all.
